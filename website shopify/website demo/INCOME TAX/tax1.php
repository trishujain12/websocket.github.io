            <h3 class="txt">2. Indirect Tax</h3>
            <p class="txt4">Taxes that are levied on services and products are called indirect tax. Indirect taxes are collected by
                the seller of the service or product. The tax is added to the price of the products and services. It
                increases the price of the product or service. There is only one indirect tax levied by the government
                currently. This is called GST or the Goods and Services Tax.
                <br>
                GST: This is a consumption tax that is levied on the supply of services and goods in India. Every step
                of the production process of any goods or value-added services is subject to the imposition of GST. It
                is supposed to be refunded to the parties that are involved in the production process (and not the final
                consumer).
                <br>
                GST resulted in the elimination of other kinds of taxes and charges such as Value Added Tax (VAT),
                octroi, customs duty, Central Value Added Tax (CENVAT), as well as customs and excise taxes. The
                products or services that are not taxed under GST are electricity, alcoholic drinks, and petroleum
                products. These are taxed as per the previous tax regime by the individual state governments.
